## ENAS-Tensorflow

I will explain the code of Efficient Neural Architecture Search(ENAS), especially micro search case.

And unlike the author's code, I rewrite the code of ENAS  for windows user!

```tex
At first you can run the ENAS with the following short code:
```
Some Markdown text with <span style="color:blue">some *blue* text</span>.
```
python main_controller_child_trainer.py
```
Roses are <span style="color:red">red</span>, violets are <span style="color:blue">blue</span>.

```diff
+ this will be highlighted in green
- this will be highlighted in red
```


```json
   // code for coloring
```
